Rather than write my next book as a series of blog posts and stitch them together, I figured I might as well just use Github and be able to get feedback more or less instantly on things.

##Lessons learned in Software Test Automation##

The idea for this book is a series of articles on a range of subjects that all somehow link to automation.

That said, the book is intended to be tool neutral so ideas will be framed as 'here is this cool thing as implemented with Se' rather than 'here is this cool Se thing'.
